This project aims to develop a sophisticated model capable of predicting an individual's Myers Briggs personality type based on their writing styles. This endeavor is challenging due to the vast diversity in human psychology and the inherent imbalance in available data for each personality type. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, I seek to establish correlations between how people express themselves in casual writing—such as social media posts—and their underlying psychological traits. I believe that the openness of expression on social platforms offers valuable insights into one's personality. Embracing the principle that all personality types hold equal value, our focus lies in ensuring fair representation and accurate prediction across the sixteen distinct Myers Briggs personality categories. Ultimately, this project strives to bridge the gap between human psychology and written expression, enhancing our understanding of personality diversity through digital communication channels.
